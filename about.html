            <p class="subtext">Hello there! I’m Sophie, and I’m a Web Developer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Originally from Ireland, I moved to Perth, Australia in 2015 and quickly fell in love with the place (as well as a rather lovely Aussie bloke!) and decided to stay. I’m a world traveller and language aficionado with proficiency in a range of 'human' languages, and I’ve had the privilege of working in many different industries, including tourism, e-commerce, media and higher education.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But it was while I was interning for national magazine, Offspring, that I found my calling. We were asked for ideas on how to improve the website, and I found myself inexplicably drawn to the ins and outs of how that might be achieved: the semantic tags to improve SEO, the animation possibilities of CSS and JavaScript, and the beauty of a well-structured HTML document. </p>
            <br>
            <p>After a year of self-paced study and online courses, I took my first brave baby steps into the tech community in Perth and found a group of like-minded individuals in She Codes. In November 2020, I graduated from the She Codes Plus Program (Perth), where I gained a range of coding skills, and of course added a few more languages to my repertoire. We got to study HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Python, Django, React, REST APIs, and more. Not only did the program give me hands-on experience with real-world code and working in an agile programming environment, but it gave me the confidence I needed to go forth and program!</p>
            <br>
            <p>But Sophie, you might ask, what use are these 'human' languages in a tech team? Well, I believe that my ability to connect and communicate not only makes me a valuable member of any work team, but a wonderful web developer as well. After all, the purpose of all code is to convey meaning. And I do that with excellence.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, if you're interested in working with me, <a class="emphasis-text" href="contact.html">drop me a line.</a> I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
